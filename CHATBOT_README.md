## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Mock OpenAI Service (`server/services/mockOpenAI.ts`)
```typescript
// Advanced intent recognition system
const intents = this.analyzeIntent(userMessage, conversationContext);

// Personalized response generation
const response = this.generateResponse(intents, userMessage, petName, petType, context);
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Advanced natural language processing for pet-related queries
- Context-aware response generation
- Comprehensive pet care knowledge base
- Simulated OpenAI response format

#### Real OpenAI Integration (`server/services/realOpenAI.ts`)
```typescript
const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o", // Latest OpenAI model
  messages: request.messages,
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 500,
});
```

#### API Endpoint (`/api/pawmate/chat`)
```typescript
// Automatic service selection
const hasOpenAIKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY && process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY.trim() !== '';

if (hasOpenAIKey) {
  // Use real OpenAI
  const realOpenAI = createRealOpenAIService(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!);
  const response = await realOpenAI.generateChatCompletion(request, petName, petType);
  res.json({ ...response, isRealAI: true });
} else {
  // Use mock service
  const response = await mockOpenAI.generateChatCompletion(request, petName, petType);
  res.json({ ...response, isRealAI: false });
}
```

### Frontend Integration

#### Enhanced Chat Component (`client/src/components/pawmate.tsx`)
```typescript
// OpenAI-compatible message format
const conversationHistory = [...messages, userMessage].map(msg => ({
  role: msg.type === 'user' ? 'user' as const : 'assistant' as const,
  content: msg.content
}));

// System prompt for context
const systemMessage = {
  role: 'system' as const,
  content: `You are PawMate, a friendly and knowledgeable AI assistant specializing in pet care...`
};

// API call with full context
const response = await fetch('/api/pawmate/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: [systemMessage, ...conversationHistory],
    petName: petName || '',
    petType: petType || 'pet'
  })
});
```
